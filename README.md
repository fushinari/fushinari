### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work on some Linux utility software that are intended to be intuitive and familiar for even users coming from other platforms. For example, [Wordbook](https://github.com/fushinari/wordbook) was made as an alternative to [WordWeb](https://wordweb.info/) on Windows. I'm also one of the maintainers of [Dialect](https://github.com/gi-lom/dialect).

I'm a Linux lover. I have two Arch installations, one with Plasma and the other with GNOME. (I use Arch btw.) Everything I make is usually specifically for Linux and I hope to keep it that way. I also love and use both Plasma and GNOME even though I do prefer Plasma over GNOME. So much so that I've begun to slowly explore and learn Plasma's code. I've already made some (very) minor contributions and hope to be able to work on it more in the future.

If you'd like to help me out, consider donating a small amount in BTC to: `bc1qrcl9jlhsm2mrjguqpmvj3rrjefju06enzz3e74` or to my UPI ID: `mufeed.666.53@okaxis`. As a student with no source of income, it would be much appreciated.
