### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work on some Linux utility software that are intended to be intuitive and familiar for even users coming from other platforms. For example, [Wordbook](https://github.com/fushinari/wordbook) was made as an alternative to [WordWeb](https://wordweb.info/) on Windows. I'm also one of the maintainers of [Dialect](https://github.com/gi-lom/dialect).

I'm a Linux lover. I have two Arch installations, one with Plasma and the other with GNOME. (I use Arch btw.) Everything I make is usually specifically for Linux and I hope to keep it that way.

Happy stuff aside, my education and my future as a whole is currently at risk. So, if you'd like to help me out, consider donating. It would be much appreciated and would help me out a lot.
